# Linguistics Librarian List
This is an _Awesome List_ for resources for Lingusitics Libarians and Language Archivists.

####Purpose
There is no association for linguistic librarians, and no open association for archivists who focus on language materials. This list exist as a resource from _linguists_ to _linguistics libarians_ to help facilitate better communication. **But** it is also a list for _archivists of language materials_ to be able to connect with archivists who deal with collections in similar mediums.

_What is a resource?_ Not a language resource (like a grammar or a description of a specific language). This list avoids these specific kinds of resources. Rather for the purposes of this list, resources might be portals, or organizations, products (like special catalogues) or journals, mailing lists, re-occuring confrences, etc. Which Linguistics Librarians and Archivists focused on language materials will find helpful in the course of thier work.

####Additions
Please organize additions by section first and then alphabetical, within a section. Fork the list. Make additions in your copy then send a pull request for additions to be added to the main list. Contributions must also agree with the license statement. _Got questions?_ create an issue.

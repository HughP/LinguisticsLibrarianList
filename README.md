# Linguistics Librarian List
This is an _Awesome List_ (which is a Github culture thing) for resources for Linguistics Librarians and Archivists dealing with _Language Artifacts_. The list is designed to be shared and contributed to.

####Purpose
There is no association for linguistic librarians, and no open association for archivists or institutional repository managers who focus on language materials. This list exists as a resource from _linguists_ to _linguistics librarians_ to help facilitate better communication. **But** it is also a list for _archivists of language materials_ to be able to connect with archivists of other kinds of materials who deal with collections in similar mediums.

_What is a resource?_ Not a language resource (like a grammar or a description of a specific language). This list avoids resources about specific languages. Rather for the purposes of this list, resources might be portals, or organizations, products (like special catalogues) or journals, mailing lists, re-occurring conferences, metadata specifications, file management tools,  etc. Which _linguistics librarians_, _special collections librarians_, and _archivists focused on language materials_ will find helpful in the course of their work (which for linguistic librarians would include directing linguists and language researchers to appropriate resources). For language archivists, who are often trained as linguists first and then land responsibilities as archivists, this list is designed to be a bridge and an introduction from one academic discipline (like linguistics) to be able to find out what is "normal" or "best practice" in another academic discipline (like preservation studies). Depending on the nature of the resource, some resources might be listed in multiple sections.

####Additions
Please organize additions by section first and then alphabetical, within a section. Fork the list. Make additions in your copy then send a pull request for additions to be added to the main list. Contributors must agree with [the license statement](https://github.com/HughP/LinguisticsLibrarianList/blob/master/README.md#license). Please add your name to the list of contributors and read the [ReadMe about contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).  _Still got questions?_ create an issue.

Sections are marked with ## in [markdown code](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) and contain a variety of sub-sections (marked with ####). The introduction of sub-sections is flexible and new ones are added as are needed for clarity (not every section will have all sub-sections). Some of these sub-sections include:
* **Best practices**: _An industry standard or agreement on how to "properly" conduct an activity or to achieve results._
* **Networks**: _Groups of people including professionals, which can be a resource as a community. Networks include links to societies, associations, and mailing lists._
* **Policies**: _Any public facing business description of business practices._
* **Services**: _A business function retuning and intangible commodity. See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics))_
* **Journals**: _Academic and professional serial publications on a particular topic or subject. As a subsection these are journals which relate only to the section, not to linguistics in general. General linguistics and language related journals have their own full section._
* **Projects**: _Specific endeavors which may be collaborative or undertaken by a single institution._  
* **Products**: _Specific things created and are usually sold. In this context products are typically software related, but may not always be software. Some products may be access to information, or subscription packages._
* **Descriptive metadata**: _Metadata schemas which describe resources._
* **Catalogues**:
* **Aggregators and index(ing) products**:
* **Digital Tools**: Software to complete a specialized task

##Resources for digital archiving - Software Tools
####Digital repositories
_These tools are designed to do digital object and associated metadata management._
* [EPrints](http://www.eprints.org/uk/) [EPrints Bazzar](http://bazaar.eprints.org/)(plugins)
* [DSpace](http://www.dspace.org/)
* [Fedora](http://fedorarepository.org/)

####Journal management systems
_There are currently no known journal management systems which have an indexing function which allows for the OLAC metadata to be recorded per article submission._ - Some further investigation is needed to determine if these CMS options create MARC records or if other kinds of indexing is still needed.
* [OJS](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) - Open Journal System
* [BePress](http://www.bepress.com/)
* De Gruyter moved in 2013 to a new backbone press application for all of its journals.
* Cambridge Journals appears to also be a custom content management system.
* Some journals like _[Pacific Review of Ethnomusicology](http://ethnomusicologyreview.ucla.edu)_ use WordPress. It is imagined that some journals also might try and use Drupal.

####Digital showcases or display environments
_These tools are designed to easily present visual interactions with archived collections. They are not designed to manage content and associated metadata in the same way that *Digital Repository* software does, rather *dispaly envirments* pull data from repositories and create interactions with it._
* [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) - This is a CMS much like WordPress but specifically designed for digital museum displays and dealing with catalogue data. [On Github](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka)
* [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/) - Scalar is a CMS which allows users to create different "pathways" (in the sense that museums have pathways through displays) through content for learning.
* [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) - This is a very powerful general purpose CMS.
* [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org/) - This is a very usable medium powered CMS (when compared with the datatypes, and ease of usability that Drupal offers).
* [Mukurtu](http://www.mukurtu.org/) - A Drupal 7 profile for managing content presented to communities. See [review 1](http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/24610/shepard.pdf?sequence=1) & [review 2](http://digitalreturn.wsu.edu/presentation/mukurtu-an-indigenous-archive-tool/)

##Major content delivery networks
_These networks often are in the business of granting a variety of access types to academic audiences. Sometimes they are publishers, sometimes they are "archives" with access products provided to via subscription to institutions._
* HathiTrust: http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/004279552
* JSTOR
* Project Muse
* [EBSCO Host](http://www.ebscohost.com/metadata-sharing-policy)

##Journals
_The study of language and linguistics covers a wide range of disciplines and sub-disciplines. Therefore a wide variety of journals may be listed as being "relevant to linguistics". A rough guess estimate is that there are about 2500 serials which are relevant to the study of language, linguistics, and culture (anthropology).  The best way to introduce these journals would be to include a title, a topical area, a link to the publisher's mast head (or the archive's presentation) and an ISSN if they have one (so far examples have only included journal titles, links, and ISSN or E-ISSN)._ **Note: Some links are to AJOL index pages rather than associational mast head websites. These should be corrected.**

##Organizations of interests in the archiving and preservation sphere (for linguistics and technical focus)
*  [Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative](http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/) - a collaborative effort by federal agencies (of the United States of America) formed as a group in 2007 to define common guidelines, methods, and practices to digitize historical content in a sustainable manner. 
*  [JISC](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/) - (Formerly the Joint Information Systems Committee.) A registered UK charity which champions the use of digital technologies in UK education and research. They have an active role in preservation and metadata developments. [See more on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jisc).
*  [Library of Congress (U.S.)](http://www.loc.gov/standards/) - The Library of Congress has extensive audio collections and is involved in many digitization projects. They host the ARSC mailing list which is a network of audio library curators and digitization specialists.  They also host several resources on standards for archiving and describing collections. 
*  [British Library](http://www.bl.uk/) - The British Library in England and the UK serves a similar function as organizations like the Smithsonian or the Library of Congress in the United States. They have a keen interest in helping other organizations to preserve or digitize their collections, as evidenced through their grant programs. They also have experience in digitizing their own collections.
* [Sound Directions](http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/projects/sounddirections/) - Is an audio preservation through digitization company. It was founded in a cooperative venture between Indiana University Bloomington and Harvard University. They are considered the leaders in audio digitization for historical collections.
* [CDP](http://www.cdpheritage.org) - Colorado Digitization Program Digital Audio Working Group, CDP started out with the name Colorado Digitization Project, then in 2004 became the Collaborative Digitization Program. It is a collaborative effort between institutions (universities and museums) in the Western United States to support their mandates to provide access to and preserve their audio collections.
* [European Broadcast Union](http://www3.ebu.ch/home) - The EBU sets standards for data interoperability within the EU for data used within their domain (radio, audio transmissions, etc). As such they are a key stakeholder and decision maker for digital audio formats.
* [SIL International](http://www.sil.org) - SIL International is a language development organization with over 80 years of history in linguistics, language development work, and Bible Translation. SIL staff over the years has worked with thousands of languages. SIL runs the Language and Culture Archive which among other things has large collections of audio materials in many languages.
* [PARADISEC](http://www.paradisec.org.au/) - Pacific And Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures, is an archive in Australia, and tied to the national university network which has pioneered digital access to media (especially audio). Much of their efforts have been lead by Nicholas Thieberger.

##General archival organizations of interest
* [Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation](http://www.conservation-us.org/)
* [Society of American Archivists](http://www2.archivists.org/)
* [Conservation OnLine](http://cool.conservation-us.org/)

##Metadata standards and schemas
_This section highlights some metadata standards and schemas in common use and why they are important for the linguistics librarian, the special collections librarian and language archivist dealing with language artifacts, and the linguist._
* DCMI - This is the premier most widely accepted and used metadata standard for metadata exchange between organizations. The standard defines broad categories and allows for some variation within those categories.
* [OLAC](http://www.language-archives.org/tools.html) - OLAC is commonly perceived as one or two of two things: 
  1. a metadata standard/schema for interoperability of linguistic resource discovery metadata
  2. a web location for doing a search for materials in participation archives

  Within the context of the metadata standard, OLAC builds upon DCMI and uses DCMI terms in addition to several extended vocabularies. OLAC is considered the best practice starting point for describing collections of linguistic and language related resources.
* [ONIX-PL](http://www.editeur.org/21/ONIX-PL/) - an XML format for the communication of license terms for digital publications in a structured and substantially encoded form, designed to serve the interests of all parties in the licensing chain.
* [ISO 639-3](http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/default.asp) - Metadata for languages.
* [MARC21](http://www.loc.gov/marc/96principl.html)
* [MARCXML]
* [OAI-PMH](http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/)
* [OAI-PMH2](http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html)
* [OAI-ORE](http://www.openarchives.org/ore/)
* [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/)
* American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard Z39.88
* American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard Z39.50 [On Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z39.50)
* [COinS](http://ocoins.info/) - ContextObject in SPAN (COinS)- Embedding Citation Metadata in HTML
* [SPAR](http://sempublishing.sourceforge.net/)

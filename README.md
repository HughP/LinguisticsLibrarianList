# Linguistics Librarian List
This is an _Awesome List_ for resources for Linguistics Librarians and Language Archivists.

####Purpose
There is no association for linguistic librarians, and no open association for archivists who focus on language materials. This list exist as a resource from _linguists_ to _linguistics librarians_ to help facilitate better communication. **But** it is also a list for _archivists of language materials_ to be able to connect with archivists who deal with collections in similar mediums.

_What is a resource?_ Not a language resource (like a grammar or a description of a specific language). This list avoids these specific kinds of resources. Rather for the purposes of this list, resources might be portals, or organizations, products (like special catalogues) or journals, mailing lists, re-occurring conferences, metadata specifications, file management tools,  etc. Which _linguistics librarians_ and _archivists focused on language materials_ will find helpful in the course of their work. In a way this list is designed for people in one academic decipline to be able to find out what is "normal" or "best practice" in another academic discipline.

####Additions
Please organize additions by section first and then alphabetical, within a section. Fork the list. Make additions in your copy then send a pull request for additions to be added to the main list. Contributions must also agree with the license statement. _Got questions?_ create an issue.

##Resources for digital archiving - Software Tools
####Digital repositories
* EPrints
* [DSpace](http://www.dspace.org/)
* Fedora
* [Islandora](http://islandora.ca/) - This is a middleware product which sits between Fedora for content management, and Drupal for custom content presentations.
* [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) - This is a very powerful general purpose CMS.

####Journal management systems
_There are currently no known journal management systems which have an indexing function which allows for the OLAC metadata to be recorded per article submission._ - Some further investigation is needed to determine if these CMS options create MARC records or if other kinds of indexing is still needed.
* [OJS](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) - Open Journal System
* [BePress](http://www.bepress.com/)
* De Gruyter moved in 2013 to a new backbone press application for all of its journals.
* Cambridge Journals appears to also be a custom content management system.
* Some journals like _[Pacific Review of Ethnomusicology](http://ethnomusicologyreview.ucla.edu)_ use WordPress. It is imagined that some journals also might try and use Drupal.

####Digital showcases or display environments
* [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) - This is a CMS much like WordPress but specifically designed for digital museum displays and dealing with catalogue data.
* [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/) - Scalar is a CMS which allows users to create different "pathways" (in the sense that museums have pathways through displays) through content for learning.
* [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) - This is a very powerful general purpose CMS.
* [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org/) - This is a very usable medium powered CMS (when compared with the datatypes, and ease of usability that Drupal offers).

####Submission managers

* SayMore - Organizes content durrent collection and creates a submission package

# Linguistics Librarian List
This is an _Awesome List_ for resources for Linguistics Librarians and Archivists dealing with _Language Artifacts_.

####Purpose
There is no association for linguistic librarians, and no open association for archivists who focus on language materials. This list exists as a resource from _linguists_ to _linguistics librarians_ to help facilitate better communication. **But** it is also a list for _archivists of language materials_ to be able to connect with archivists of other kinds of materials who deal with collections in similar mediums.

_What is a resource?_ Not a language resource (like a grammar or a description of a specific language). This list avoids these specific kinds of resources. Rather for the purposes of this list, resources might be portals, or organizations, products (like special catalogues) or journals, mailing lists, re-occurring conferences, metadata specifications, file management tools,  etc. Which _linguistics librarians_ and _archivists focused on language materials_ will find helpful in the course of their work. In a way this list is designed for people in one academic decipline to be able to find out what is "normal" or "best practice" in another academic discipline.

####Additions
Please organize additions by section first and then alphabetical, within a section. Fork the list. Make additions in your copy then send a pull request for additions to be added to the main list. Contributions must also agree with the license statement. _Got questions?_ create an issue.

Sections are marked with ## and contain a variety of sub-sections (marked with ####) as sub-sections are needed for clarity (not every section will have all sub-sections). Some of these sub-sections include:
* **Best practices**: _An industry standard or agreement on how to "properly" conduct an activity or to achive results._
* **Networks**: _Groups of people including professionals, which can be a resource as a community. Networks inlcude links to societies, associations, and mailing lists._
* **Policies**: _Any public facing business description of business practices._
* **Services**: _A buiness function retuning and intangable commodity. See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics))_
* **Journals**: _Academic and professional serial publications on a particular topic or subject. As a subsection these are journals which relate only to the section, not to linguistics in general. General linguistics and language related journals have their own full section._
* **Projects**: _Specific endevors which may be colaborative or undertaken by a single institution._  
* **Products**: _Specific things created and are usally sold. In this context products are typically software related, but may not always be software. Some products may be access to information, or subscription packages._
* **Descriptive metadata**: _Metadata schemas which describe resources._
* **Catalogues**:
* **Aggregators and index(ing) products**:

* [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) - This is a very powerful general purpose CMS.


####Journal management systems
_There are currently no known journal management systems which have an indexing function which allows for the OLAC metadata to be recorded per article submission._ - Some further investigation is needed to determine if these CMS options create MARC records or if other kinds of indexing is still needed.
* [OJS](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) - Open Journal System
* [BePress](http://www.bepress.com/)

* [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/) - Scalar is a CMS which allows users to create different "pathways" (in the sense that museums have pathways through displays) through content for learning.
* [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) - This is a very powerful general purpose CMS.

##Journals
_The study of language and linguistics covers a wide range of diciplines and sub-diciplines. Therefore a wid variety of journals may be listed as being "relevant to linguistics". The best way to introduce these journals would be to include a title, a topical area, a link to the publisher's mast head (or the archive's presentation) and an ISSN if they have one. (so far examples have only included journal titles, links, and ISSN or E-ISSN.)_ **Note: Some links are to AJOL index pages rather than associational mast head websites. These should be corrected.**
